# EIGRP
EIGRP (Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol) is a Cisco proprietary advanced distance-vector routing protocol used for routing decisions within a computer network. It is designed to be efficient and scalable, particularly in large and complex networks.
Here are some key features and characteristics of EIGRP:


`Advanced Features:` EIGRP includes features such as rapid convergence, minimal network traffic, and support for multiple network layer protocols. It uses Diffusing Update Algorithm (DUAL) to calculate the shortest path to a destination.


`Fast Convergence:` EIGRP is known for its fast convergence time, which means that it can quickly adapt to network changes such as link failures or topology changes.


`Reduced Bandwidth Usage:` EIGRP uses a variety of techniques to reduce the amount of bandwidth used for routing updates. It sends partial updates only when there is a change in the network, which helps in conserving network resources.


`VLSM and CIDR Support:` EIGRP supports Variable Length Subnet Masking (VLSM) and Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR), allowing for efficient use of IP address space.


`Cisco Proprietary:` EIGRP is a Cisco proprietary protocol, which means it is primarily used in Cisco networking devices. This can be a limitation if you have a multi-vendor network environment.


`Hybrid Protocol:` EIGRP combines features of both distance-vector and link-state routing protocols, offering the advantages of both while minimizing their limitations.


Overall, EIGRP is a robust and efficient routing protocol that is well-suited for Cisco-based networks, providing fast convergence, scalability, and reduced network traffic.
